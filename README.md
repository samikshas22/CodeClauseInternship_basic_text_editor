A straightforward text editor web application is created by all of the provided code files. Using features like bold, italic, text alignment, font size, text case, and more, the application enables users to input and format text. JavaScript is used to make the UI interactive, while HTML and CSS are used to style the UI.

**Tools used** 
1) HTML
   The layout of the text editor and the web page's structure are both created using HTML.
2) CSS
   CSS is used to style HTML elements, bringing visual appeal, and defining the text editor's appearance.
3) JavaScript
   Text formatting, alignment, and other features are made possible in the text editor thanks to JavaScript's interactive 
   functionality.

Steps:
1) "index.html"
The organization and design of a text editor web application are specified in the "index.html" file. It includes Bootstrap for styling and uses HTML to create a number of elements, including buttons and a textarea for text input. A header, text formatting buttons, and a textarea are all included in the structure. The textarea is styled with Bootstrap classes, and buttons have corresponding icons and text-formatting functionality.

2) "style.css"
The styling guidelines for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file are contained in the "style.css" file. It specifies the text editor's visual elements, such as text alignment, margins, padding, colors, and font sizes. The elements are arranged into an aesthetically pleasing layout according to the CSS rules, which also specify how they should be shown on the web page.

3) "index.js"
The JavaScript code for the text editor's functionality and interactivity is found in the "index.js" file. It adds event listeners to buttons and selects various HTML elements based on their IDs. This file's functions regulate operations like switching between bold and italic text, altering text alignment, changing text case, modifying font size and colour, and enabling printing capabilities.

Together, these three files produce a useful text editor web application that offers users a straightforward and user-friendly interface for formatting text. The JavaScript file implements the dynamic behaviour and functionality of the text editor, while the HTML file supplies the structure and the CSS file styles the elements.
